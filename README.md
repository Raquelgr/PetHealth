A school project of System's Organization and Connectivity at COLTEC UFMG, which we must integrate hardware and software. The project called PetHealth, which the idea consists of a pet-accessible collar or clothing integrated with hardware with temperature sensor and accelerometer, and then this information will be provided in an application or site.
